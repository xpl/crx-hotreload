# Chrome Extension Hot Reloader

Watches for file changes in your extension's directory. When a change is detected, it reloads the extension and refreshes the active tab (to re-trigger the updated scripts).

Here's [a blog post explaining it](https://60devs.com/hot-reloading-for-chrome-extensions.html) (thanks to [KingOfNothing](https://habrahabr.ru/users/KingOfNothing/) for the translation).

## Features

- Works by checking timestamps of files
- Supports nested directories
- Automatically disables itself in production
- And it's just <a href="https://github.com/xpl/crx-hotreload/blob/master/hot-reload.js">50 lines of code</a>!

## Options

|  Name        |   Value                    |  Description                           |
|--------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `reloadTab`  | `boolean` (default: true)  | reload the active tab when crx changes.|

## How To Use

1. Drop [`hot-reload.js`](https://github.com/xpl/crx-hotreload/blob/master/hot-reload.js) to your extension's directory.

2. Put the following into your `manifest.json` file:

```json
    "background": { "scripts": ["hot-reload.js"] }
```

Also, you can simply clone this repository and use it as a boilerplate for your extension.

## Installing From NPM

It is also available as NPM module:

```
npm install crx-hotreload
```

In your script:
```
const hotReload = require('crx-hotreload');
hotReload.default({
    reloadTab: false
});
```
